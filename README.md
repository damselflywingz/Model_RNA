# Modelling Potential RNA:RNA Interactions Between SARS-CoV-2 and Human Transcriptome

## *Pitch*
We aim to integrate the latest SARS-Cov-2 transcriptome and RNA secondary structure data to predict potential pathogen and host RNA:RNA interactions. We also will be attempting to integrate new findings regarding a common secondary modification found in the sub genome RNA of the virus. We hope to produce a bioinformatics pipeline, an interactive visualization of the predicted network, and deposit our dataset into the RNA society virBASE repository.

## *Description*
Given the short timescale between when SARS-Cov-2 was first discovered and when it was designated a pandemic, there is next-to-no high-throughput data for the virus. This precludes in-depth integrative, systems-level analyses on it and as such our understanding of the large-scale effects it has on cellular behaviour are limited. However, there is such data for other coronaviruses, namely the 2003 outbreak strain (which SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be closely related to) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, alongside other less well-documented coronaviruses. Using these data, differential expression analyses and various gene regulatory network construction methods, it may be possible to identify "consensus" modules/pathways that are dysregulated by all coronaviruses, or at least in coronaviruses that are highly related (SARS coronaviruses). Modules/pathways identified this way could then be compared to the current SARS-CoV-2 literature to identify any evidence that these gene sets are dys-regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the aim of providing better understanding of the life cycle of the virus and how the virus causes COVID-19.

## *Objective*
* identify any novel pathogenic mechanisms, which may serve as potential targets for therapeutics. The output will be a visualization of the most robust network of host-virus RNA:RNA interactions.
